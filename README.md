# Portfolio

I'm working on a web site that I will use as a portfolio showing some coding projects I completed in the past. Before choosing a host server and doing all the minutia associated with having a website, I will implement a basic version of it on GitHub. That repository is where I'll dump all the files that could be usefull for that website, but that are useless for now.

So feel free to look at my code and comments on my old projects while I'm building that web site and if you learn something while browsing my files or have a good idea for my site, let me know!
